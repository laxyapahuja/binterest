Save all pins in your board locally

## How to use
1. Make sure your board is public.
2. Go to your board and open developer's console(Ctrl + Shift + I)
3. Go to Console tab and paste the contents of `console.js` in the console.
4. The console will now log a link. Copy that link.
5. Run `main.py` and paste the link there.
6. The program will automatically download all pins in the current working directory.

There is currently a limit to the maximum that you can download which is 250. Will have to see if it can be improved in the future.
